# NeuralNetworks
# Homework from cs246, where you had to implement decorator patterns to demonstrate simple neural networks on  to compute boolean functions AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. To compute the output of a
# neural network, values flow through layers of nodes. We start with input nodes, that are fed some initial float values. From
# there, we can perform transformations that change the values of nodes as they flow from layer to layer.

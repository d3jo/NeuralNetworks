# NeuralNetworks
# Homework from cs246, where you had to implement decorator patterns to demonstrate simple neural networks on  to compute boolean functions AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. To compute the output of a neural network, values flow through layers of nodes. We start with input nodes, that are fed some initial float values. Fromthere, we can perform transformations that change the values of nodes as they flow from layer to layer.

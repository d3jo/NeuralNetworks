# NeuralNetworks
Homework from CS246, a software object oriented programming course, where Decorator design pattern was used to demonstrate simple neural networks to compute boolean functions AND, OR, NOT, and XOR. To compute the output of a neural network, values flow through layers of nodes. We start with input nodes, that are fed some initial float values. From there, we can perform transformations that change the values of nodes as they flow from layer to layer.
